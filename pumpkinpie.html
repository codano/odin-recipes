    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      it's proof that a good recipe doesn't necessarily need to be a complicated
      one â€” you get a great result with canned pumpkin puree and store-bought
      pie crust. Of course, you can customize it to suit your preferences by
      using fresh pumpkin or a homemade pie crust for that from-scratch taste.
      Plus, it can be made ahead of time and refrigerated (or frozen) until
      you're ready to serve! Your search for the perfect pumpkin pie ends here.
